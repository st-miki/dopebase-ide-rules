# Flutter State Management Best Practices

## State Management Patterns
- Use `Provider` for simple state management and dependency injection
- Implement `ChangeNotifier` for reactive state updates
- Consider `Bloc` pattern for complex business logic separation
- Use `Riverpod` for advanced state management with compile-time safety
- Implement `setState` only for local widget state
- Choose the right pattern based on app complexity and team expertise

## Provider Pattern
- Use `ChangeNotifierProvider` for mutable state
- Use `Provider` for immutable data and services
- Use `MultiProvider` to provide multiple dependencies
- Implement proper provider disposal and cleanup
- Use `Consumer` and `Selector` widgets for efficient rebuilds
- Avoid overusing providers; keep state local when possible

## Bloc Pattern
- Separate business logic from UI using Bloc classes
- Use `BlocBuilder` for reactive UI updates
- Implement proper event handling with `Bloc.add()`
- Use `BlocListener` for side effects and navigation
- Create focused, single-responsibility blocs
- Use `BlocProvider` for dependency injection

## State Design
- Keep state immutable using `freezed` or similar packages
- Use sealed classes for state variants
- Implement proper state transitions and validation
- Avoid storing UI-specific data in business state
- Use proper state serialization for persistence
- Design state to be easily testable

## Performance Considerations
- Use `Selector` widget to rebuild only when specific state changes
- Implement proper state comparison to avoid unnecessary rebuilds
- Use `const` constructors for widgets that don't depend on state
- Avoid creating objects in build methods
- Use `RepaintBoundary` for expensive widgets
- Profile state management performance regularly

## Error Handling in State
- Implement proper error states in your state classes
- Use `Either` pattern for operations that can fail
- Handle loading states appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring

## Testing State Management
- Write unit tests for state management logic
- Test state transitions and side effects
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Use `bloc_test` package for Bloc testing
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Implement integration tests for state flows

## State Persistence
- Use `SharedPreferences` for simple key-value storage
- Implement proper state serialization
- Use `Hive` or `Isar` for complex local storage
- Consider `HydratedBloc` for automatic state persistence
- Handle state migration when app updates
- Implement proper data validation on restore

## Global vs Local State
- Keep state as local as possible to the widgets that need it
- Use global state only for truly app-wide data
- Implement proper state lifting when needed
- Avoid prop drilling by using appropriate state management
- Consider state composition for complex scenarios
- Document state ownership and responsibilities

## State Management Architecture
- Follow consistent patterns throughout the application
- Use dependency injection for state management services
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Create reusable state management components
- Use proper naming conventions for state classes
- Document state management decisions and patterns
