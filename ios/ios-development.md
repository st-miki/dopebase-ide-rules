# iOS Development - General Best Practices

## Code Style & Architecture
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for UI/UX design
- Use MVC, MVVM, or VIPER architecture patterns consistently
- Implement proper separation of concerns between layers
- Use dependency injection for better testability and modularity
- Follow SOLID principles for maintainable code
- Use proper error handling with `Result` type and custom errors

## Memory Management
- Use ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) effectively
- Avoid retain cycles by using weak references in closures
- Implement proper cleanup in `deinit` methods
- Use `weak` and `unowned` appropriately for delegate patterns
- Monitor memory usage with Instruments
- Handle memory warnings properly in view controllers

## Performance Optimization
- Use lazy loading for expensive operations
- Implement proper image caching and optimization
- Use background queues for heavy computations
- Optimize table view and collection view performance
- Use Core Data efficiently with proper fetch requests
- Profile performance regularly with Instruments

## Networking & Data
- Use `URLSession` for network requests with proper error handling
- Implement proper caching strategies for API responses
- Use `Codable` for JSON serialization and deserialization
- Handle network connectivity and offline scenarios
- Implement proper request/response logging for debugging
- Use background app refresh appropriately

## User Interface
- Follow iOS design patterns and conventions
- Implement proper auto layout constraints
- Use size classes for responsive design
- Support dark mode and dynamic type
- Implement proper accessibility features
- Test on different device sizes and orientations

## Security
- Use Keychain for sensitive data storage
- Implement proper certificate pinning for network security
- Validate all user inputs and API responses
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Implement biometric authentication when appropriate
- Follow OWASP mobile security guidelines

## Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic and utilities
- Implement UI tests for critical user flows
- Use dependency injection for testable code
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Use `XCTest` framework for comprehensive testing

## App Store Guidelines
- Follow Apple's App Store Review Guidelines
- Implement proper privacy policies and data handling
- Use appropriate app metadata and descriptions
- Handle app updates and version compatibility
- Implement proper crash reporting and analytics
- Test thoroughly before submission

## Localization
- Use `NSLocalizedString` for all user-facing text
- Implement proper pluralization rules
- Support right-to-left languages when needed
- Test with different locale settings
- Use proper date and number formatting
- Implement proper currency and measurement units

## Background Processing
- Use background app refresh appropriately
- Implement proper background task handling
- Use push notifications effectively
- Handle app state transitions properly
- Implement proper data synchronization
- Use background processing for non-critical tasks

## Code Quality
- Use SwiftLint for consistent code style
- Implement proper code documentation
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid code duplication through proper abstraction
- Implement proper logging and debugging tools
- Use version control effectively with proper commit messages
